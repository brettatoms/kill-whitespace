# Shrink Whitespaces

This plugin gives you `shrink_whitespaces` command for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/). With it you can:
* Convert a set of blank lines in just one blank line, or
* Remove the blank line that is between two paragraphs, or
* Remove a set of whitespaces between two words, or
* Remove the whitespace between two letters.

The action depends on the context where the command is used.

Default keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Alt+W</kbd>

Based on [ErgoEmacs](http://www.ergoemacs.org/)'s [shrink-whitespaces](http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/issues/detail?id=13) function, which is a combination of three Emacs functions: `just-one-space`, `delete-blank-lines`, and `delete-horizontal-space`.
